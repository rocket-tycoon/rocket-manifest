    Living feature documentation server for AI-assisted development.

    RocketManifest tracks **features** (system capabilities) rather than work items.
    Features are living descriptions that evolve with the codebase, organized in a
    hierarchical tree structure under projects.

    ## Core Concepts

    - **Project**: Groups features, directories, and git remotes for a codebase
    - **Feature**: A capability of the system, organized hierarchically
    - **Session**: A work session on a leaf feature (only one active per feature)
    - **Task**: Work unit within a session, assigned to an AI agent (can have sub-tasks)
    - **History**: Append-only log of implementation sessions
